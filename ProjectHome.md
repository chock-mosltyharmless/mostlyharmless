mostly harmless is a demogroup founded in 2005. Several demos were released by mostly harmless.

In order to make our demoscene stuff more accessible, we decided to go open source. The code quality will not be very high, though.

This project contains:
- demos
- demotools
- prototypes (octave, rendermonkey, ...)
